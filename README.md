# PythonML

This bootcamp is designed to learn the basics of machine learning.  
The bootcamp has been created by 42_AI, an association of 42 Paris.    
ML Bootcamp repository (subjects): https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning.  
42-AI repository and presentation: https://github.com/42-AI.  

This bootcamp is a "hands on" that rely on the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" MOOC from Stanford University.

## ml_00
The goal of this module is to discover the concept of linear regression. You will study, in this module the keys concepts in linear algebra to achieve univariate linear regression.  

## ml_01
The goal of this module is to get started with the basics of linear regression. You will study, in the field of machine learning, what we call an hypothesis, cost function, gradient descent and some notions of feature scaling.  

## ml_02
The goal of this module is building on what you did on the previous modules. You will extend the linear regression to handle more than one features. Then you will see how to build polynomial models and how to detect overfitting.
